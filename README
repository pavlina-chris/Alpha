AlCo is written in Java. Compile requirements:

    Make
    C compiler
    JDK
    Python 2 or 3

Run requirements:

    JRE
    LLVM
    binutils

To build, just type "make". Two files will be generated:

    alco.jar: compiler code
    alco: compiler launcher

    'alco' launches "java -jar JARFILE", where JARFILE is ./alco.jar
    if present, or else /usr/lib/alco.jar.


NOTE ABOUT JCOMMANDER:

    AlCo uses JCommander. The source is included under jcommander/. If you
    replace this source with new, make sure to copy over jcommander/build.py
    and jcommander/Makefile. JCommander uses Maven, which is obnoxiously huge
    and requires massive amounts of downloaded crap, so I replaced its build
    system.

NOTE ABOUT DOCUMENTATION:

    "make alcodoc" documents the internal AlCo code, not the Alpha language.
    I haven't written the alpha docs yet. If you need a quick visual look at
    the AlCo code, then do "make alcodoc".
