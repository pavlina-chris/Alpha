ALPHA is a new programming language. It is meant to be good for both systems
and general purpose programming. It is garbage-collected, though you may free
memory manually if you choose, and you may elect to compile without GC.

ALPHA is roughly object-based, but not object-oriented - there is no class
hierarchy.
